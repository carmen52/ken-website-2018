<h2>My Story</h2>
<p> I grew up near Sharon Center, Ohio in Medina County. I got my first job at the age of 14 washing dishes on weekends at a local Medina restaurant, Mozena's. After high school I joined the Marine Corps and served four years, earning promotions to Corporal (E-4) before being honorably discharged.  I then attended The University of Akron, majoring in Business. I have since worked more than 20 years in Columbus law firm accounting departments. While working full-time, I attended Hondros College real estate courses and The Ohio Auction School to obtain real estate and auctioneering licenses. I look forward to assisting folks with real estate and auction services. I enjoy spending free time with my family in Grove City. </p>
